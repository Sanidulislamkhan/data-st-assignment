    "Q.1.  Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a  regular Python list?\n",
    "Ans: Because with a regular python list you can not perform pop-left or pop-right, for this operation we have to import deque from collections module. deque is optimized for fast insertions and deletions from both ends of the queue. Appending and popping elements from the left and right ends of a deque have O(1) time complexity, making it suitable for queue operations like enqueue and dequeue."

    "Q.2. Can you explain a real-world scenario where using a stack would be a more practical choice than a list for data storage and retrieval?\n",
    "Ans: When a user requests to undo the last action, the application retrieves the most recent operation/command object from the top of the stack, reverses the effects of that action, and updates the document or design accordingly. In contrast, using a list for this scenario would require more complex logic to manage the order of actions and perform efficient undo operations, as elements would need to be inserted and removed at specific positions in the list to maintain the correct sequence of actions. This can lead to slower performance and more complicated code. Therefore, a stack is a more practical choice for implementing the \"Undo\" functionality in real-world applications."

    "Q.3. What is the primary advantage of using sets in Python, and in what type of problem-solving scenarios are they most useful?\n",
    "Ans: The primary advantage of using sets in Python is their ability to efficiently store and manipulate unique elements. Sets automatically handle duplicate elements by storing only distinct values, which makes them highly efficient for various operations such as membership testing, intersection, union, and difference. Sets are most useful in problem-solving scenarios that involve dealing with collections of unique elements or performing set-related operations efficiently. Some common problem-solving scenarios where sets are valuable include: Removing duplicates from a list or collection, Counting the number of unique elements in a dataset, Finding common elements or differences between multiple collections."

    "Q.4. When might you choose to use an array instead of a list for storing numerical data in Python? What benefits do arrays offer in this context?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, arrays and lists both provide ways to store collections of data. However, arrays are specialized data structures designed specifically for storing homogeneous numerical data. While lists are more flexible and can store elements of any data type, arrays offer several benefits for storing numerical data: Arrays typically consume less memory than lists, especially when storing large amounts of numerical data, Arrays offer better performance for numerical computations compared to lists, arrays support direct access to elements using index-based retrieval, similar to lists."

    "Q.5. In Python, what's the primary difference between dictionaries and lists, and how does this difference impact their use cases in programming?\n",
    "Ans: 1. Lists are ordered collections of elements but dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.\n",
    "     2. Elements in a list are indexed by sequential integers, starting from 0 but Elements in a dictionary are accessed by keys, which can be of any immutable type.\n",
    "     3. Lists allow duplicate elements and maintain the order in which elements are inserted but Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys; each key must be unique within the dictionary.\n",
    "     4. Lists are represented by square brackets ([]) but Dictionaries are represented by curly braces ({}), with each key-value pair separated by a colon (:) and pairs separated by commas.\n",
    "     \n",
    "How does this difference impact their use cases in programming:\n",
    "    List: Lists are suitable for storing collections of homogeneous elements where the order of elements matters. They are commonly used for sequences of items that need to be accessed by index or     iterated over in a specific order. Examples include arrays of numbers, sequences of strings, or collections of objects.  \n",
    "    Dictionaries: Dictionaries are ideal for storing collections of heterogeneous data where each element is accessed by a unique key. They are commonly used for representing mappings between keys and values, such as storing settings, configurations, or database records keyed by identifiers. Dictionaries are also used for efficient lookups and retrieval of data based on specific keys.\n",
